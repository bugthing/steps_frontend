Steps Frontend
==============

This is a EmberJS frontend to a toy project currently in development

Running the App
---------------

To run the app, open the index.html in an up to date browser.

The app uses either Ember's Fixtures or it can speak to a REST backend.

The plan is to build a very simple Rack and ActiveModelSerializer based backend.

To get the required REST API up and running:

    bundle install

The to run the server

    rackup

Now visit: (http://0:9292/)[http://0:9292/]

-----

You can see is the tests pass by visiting the (http://0:9292/test.html)[test.html] page in an up to date browser.

.. or you can run the specs for the Rack app, like so:

    bundle exec rspec
